Add sticky notes directly to website content.

Communicate and collaborate by leaving sticky notes on any page of your site. Drag 'n drop them anywhere you'd like, type a note, change it's color/priority, and even choose whether or not the public can see them.

Here's how it works:

* While signed in, go to any page on your site
* Click the **Add Note** button in the admin bar at the top of the screen
* Click and grab the top of the note to move it anywhere on the page
* Type your note text
* Use the pallette button in the upper right of your note to cycle through different priority colors
* Click the save button in the lower right of your note to keep your changes
